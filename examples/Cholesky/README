Cholesky decomposition example for CnC-OCR
==========================================

This example application is part of the CnC-OCR distribution. For copyright
and license information, please see the LICENSE file in xstack/hll/cnc/.

Follow the instructions in the CnC-OCR README for building and installing the
CnC-OCR runtime and toolchain. At a minimum, you should set the XSTG_ROOT
environment variable to the path to your xstack repository checkout. Running
the run_test.sh script (as described at the end of this README) should build,
run and verify this application.

This example has two versions. One reads the input matrix from a file, which is
the same functionality as the OCR Cholesky example. This version is in the
"file_input" subdirectory. The other version automatically generates an input
matrix, and is located in the "generated_input" subdirectory. We also included
a symbolic link to "generated_input" called "default_project" to indicate that
it is the simpler version of the app (no file I/O) and should be preferred.

Note that the "common" directory does not contain a full application. The
directory contains only the common files shared between the two versions,
and those files are softlinked in the directories of the two full projects.

The file-input version of the application produces the factorized result
matrix as an output file. For the generated-input version, the output matrix
is simply checksummed, and that checksum is printed as the result. Since the
checksum is influenced by rounding errors in the computation, the result may
differ for the same input when using a different math library.

The input file version of the application does not provide support code to
preprocess the input file for FSim (TG) compatibility; therefore, only the
generated input version currently supports running on the TG simulator.

This example includes the following files:

    * Cholesky.cnc:
        Specification for this application's CnC graph structure.

    * Main.c:
        Entry point for the application. Precesses command-line arguments,
        creates a CnC graph, and launches the computation.

    * Cholesky.c:
        Contains the initialization and finalization functions for the CnC
        graph. The init function does the initial puts and prescribes, and
        also sets the parameters for the finalization function. The
        finalization function reads the final tile values.

    * Cholesky_defs.h
        A header included globally in the make process that provides the
        definitions for all non-primitive types referenced in Cholesky.cnc.

    * Cholesky_sequentialStep.c, Cholesky_trisolveStep.c Cholesky_updateStep.c
        The step code for the three stages of the Cholesky computation.

    * Cholesky_common.h
        This header is included in Cholesky_defs.h, containing definitions
        common between the two versions of the application.

    * run_test.sh:
        A shell script that runs the translator, makes the application
        binary, runs the application and finally verifies the output.

The "common" subdirectory contains common files, which are soft-linked in each
of the versions' subdirectories. Only Main.c, Cholesky.c and Cholesky_defs.h
are modified between the two versions.

You must run the CnC-OCR graph translator tool to generate the scaffolding
code, and compile the application using the provided Makefile. You can use
the provided shell script to build and run the application:

        ./run_test.sh

The script runs the Cholesky computation with a moderate-sized input. The test
should complete in less than 10 seconds, and if it was successful you should
see an "OK" printed at the end of the output.
