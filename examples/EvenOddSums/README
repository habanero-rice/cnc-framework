Simple summing example for CnC
==================================

Follow the instructions in the CnC README for building and installing the
CnC runtime and toolchain.

This program sums the even numbers and sums the odd numbers in the range from
zero to n. The two sums are computed in parallel.

This example includes the following files:

    * EvenOddSums.cnc:
        Specification for this application's CnC graph structure. This graph
        uses "virtual" item collections, which simply provide a mapping from
        the "virtual" keyspace onto the keyspace of another item collection.
        This lets us refer to ranges of even and odd numbers in the graph.
        The graph specification also makes use of the optional arguments that
        can be provided to the intialization function (rather than using the
        graph context). See the comments in the graph spec for more details.

    * EvenOddSums.c:
        Contains the initialization and finalization functions for the CnC
        graph. The init function does the initial puts and prescribes, and
        also sets the (null) parameters for the finalization function. The
        finalization function reads the single item in each of the "Totals"
        collections, and prints the results.

    * EvenOddSums_sumEvens.c, EvenOddSums_sumOdds.c
        The step functions for summing the even and odd numbers in the range
        from zero to n. The two functions are actually identical except for
        the names of the identifiers used.

You need to run the CnC graph translator tool to generate the scaffolding
code, and compile the application using the generated Makefile. You can also
run the application via make. It takes the "n" value as an argument.

        ucnc_t EvenOddSums.cnc
        make run WORKLOAD_ARGS=100

A successful run should yield output like the following:

    Even total = 2450
    Odd total = 2500
