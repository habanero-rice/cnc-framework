Combinations (n choose k) example for CnC
=============================================

Follow the instructions in the CnC README for building and installing the
CnC runtime and toolchain.

This program finds the value "n choose k" by calculating the first n rows of
Pascal's Triangle. This is also the primary example used in the CnC Overview
document available here: https://habanero.rice.edu/CnC+Resources

This example includes the following files:

    * Combinations.cnc:
        Specification for this application's CnC graph structure. See the
        comments in the file for a more detailed description.

    * Combinations.c:
        Contains the initialization and finalization functions for the CnC
        graph. The init function does the initial puts and prescribes, and
        also sets the (null) parameters for the finalization function. The
        finalization function reads the value from row "n", column "k" of
        the triangle, and prints that value as the result.

    * Combinations_addToInside.c
        The step functions for creating entries on the inside of the triangle.
        These entries are computed by summing the two values in the row above,
        at the current column and column-1. It also prescribes a step to
        compute the entry in the same column of the next row.

    * Combinations_addToLeftEdge.c, Combinations_addToRightEdge.c
        The step functions for creating entries on the left and right edges of
        the triangle. These values are always 1, so the calculation is trival.
        Both steps prescribe the computation to compute an entry in the next
        row (just like addToInside), but the addToRightEdge step additionally
        prescribes an extra entry to expand that edge of the triangle.

You need to run the CnC graph translator tool to generate the scaffolding
code, and compile the application using the generated Makefile. You can also
run the application via make. It takes the "n" and "k" values as an argument.

        ucnc_t Combinations.cnc
        make run WORKLOAD_ARGS="10 7"

A successful run should yield output like the following:

    10 choose 7 = 120
