Smith-Waterman example for CnC-OCR
==================================

This example application is part of the CnC-OCR distribution. For copyright
and license information, please see the LICENSE file in xstack/hll/cnc/.

Follow the instructions in the CnC-OCR README for building and installing the
CnC-OCR runtime and toolchain. At a minimum, you should set the XSTG_ROOT
environment variable to the path to your xstack repository checkout. Running
the run_test.sh script (as described at the end of this README) should build,
run and verify this application.

Smith-Waterman is a gene sequence alignment application. The application takes
two gene sequences as input (files), and produces a score representing how
different the two sequences are. The score is computed using a standard edit-
distance algorithm (using dynamic programming).

This example includes the following files:

    * SmithWaterman.cnc:
        Specification for this application's CnC graph structure.

    * Main.c:
        Entry point for the application. Includes the code to read the input
        files into a datablock, create a CnC graph, and launch the computation.

    * SmithWaterman.c:
        Contains the initialization and finalization functions for the CnC
        graph. The init function does the initial puts and prescribes, and
        also sets the parameters for the finalization function. The
        finalization function reads the final item from the computation
        and prints the sequence score.

    * SmithWaterman_swStep.c
        The step code for the dynamic programming computation, calculating the
        maximal-score path through a single tile of the score matrix.

    * SmithWaterman_defs.h
        A header included globally in the make process that provides the
        definitions for all non-primitive types referenced in SmithWaterman.cnc.

    * run_test.sh:
        A shell script that runs the translator, makes the application
        binary, runs the application and finally verifies the output.

You need to run the CnC-OCR graph translator tool to generate the scaffolding
code, and compile the application using the provided Makefile. You can use
the provided shell script to build and run the application:

        ./run_test.sh

The script runs the Smith-Waterman application twice. The first run uses very
small input sequences, and the second run uses much larger input sequences. The
script will verify that the correct score is calculated, printing OK if found.
A successful run should yield output like the following (the times will vary):
